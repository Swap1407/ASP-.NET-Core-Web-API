## **Why Do We Need Web APIs?**

### **Problems Without Web APIs**

When developing applications like a website, Android app, or iOS app that directly connect to a shared database, the following challenges arise:

- **Duplicate Logic:** Business logic is duplicated across different platforms.
- **Error-Prone Code:** Maintaining consistency across multiple applications increases the likelihood of errors.
- **Limited Communication:** Some front-end frameworks (e.g., Angular) cannot directly interact with databases.
- **Complex Maintenance:** Managing similar code across platforms becomes difficult and inefficient.

### **Solution: Web APIs**

A **Web API** provides a centralized communication interface between the database and various client applications, as shown below:

```
[Website]      [Android App]      [iOS App]
      \             |              /
       \            |             /
        \_______[Web API]________/
                    |
             [Database]
```

### **Advantages of Web APIs**

- **Platform Independence:** APIs work across different clients (web, mobile, IoT) via HTTP.
- **Lightweight Communication:** Supports formats like JSON and XML for efficient data exchange.
- **Centralized Logic:** Reduces code duplication and ensures consistency.
- **Security:** Provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization.
- **Scalability:** Allows for easy integration with new platforms or features.

## **What is Web API?**

A **Web API** is a set of rules that allows applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It is built on HTTP and commonly uses RESTful principles to exchange data.

Example Web API Endpoints:
- `GET /weather/today?location=London` - Retrieves today’s weather for London.
- `POST /books` - Adds a new book to the system.

## **What is ASP.NET Core Web API?**

**ASP.NET Core Web API** is a lightweight framework provided by Microsoft for building RESTful HTTP services. It is part of the ASP.NET Core framework and is ideal for creating APIs that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and IoT devices.

### **Key Features of ASP.NET Core Web API**

- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Built-in dependency injection.
- Lightweight and fast, using the ASP.NET Core runtime.
- Secure, with features like authentication and authorization.
- Easily integrates with modern front-end frameworks (React, Angular, etc.).

## **Why Do We Need ASP.NET Core Web API?**

ASP.NET Core Web API is essential for modern application development because it:

- Facilitates **cross-platform development** by enabling all client types to interact with the same API.
- Supports **stateless communication**, which is essential for REST principles.
- Provides a robust **pipeline for handling HTTP requests**.
- Ensures **high performance** with minimal resource usage.

## **What is REST?**

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for building scalable web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods and resources to perform CRUD operations.

### **Key REST Principles**

1. **Statelessness:** Each API call is independent and does not rely on previous interactions.
2. **Resource-Based URLs:** Resources are identified by URLs (e.g., `/products/1` for Product ID 1).
3. **HTTP Methods:** Standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are used for communication.
4. **Representation:** Resources are typically represented using JSON or XML.
5. **Cacheability:** Responses should indicate whether they can be cached to improve performance.

## **Difference between ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET Core Web API**

| **Aspect**              | **ASP.NET Web API**                                                                 | **ASP.NET Core Web API**                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Support**     | Built on the .NET Framework, runs only on Windows.                                   | Part of the ASP.NET Core framework, runs on .NET Core, making it cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).                     |
| **Performance**          | Efficient but limited by the older architecture and .NET Framework.                  | Lightweight and high-performance, optimized for modern needs with extensive support for asynchronous programming.            |
| **API Design Features**  | Supports RESTful services but lacks native support for features like versioning or response compression. | Includes built-in features like API versioning, response caching, and response compression for robust API design.            |
| **Configuration and Hosting** | Hosted in IIS, uses `web.config` for configuration.                                       | Can be hosted in IIS, Kestrel, or Docker containers. Uses JSON files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.     |
| **Dependency Injection** | Supported but relies on third-party libraries like Unity or Ninject.                  | Built-in dependency injection support, promoting loosely coupled and manageable code.                                       |
| **Middleware Support**   | No middleware pipeline; uses custom handlers and modules, which are complex to implement. | Built on a middleware pipeline for easy customization and configuration (e.g., authentication, error handling, logging).     |
| **Community and Future Support** | Part of the older .NET Framework; only receives bug fixes and security updates.           | Actively developed with new features, benefiting from Microsoft’s focus on modern ASP.NET Core architecture.                |
| **Choosing Factors**     | Suitable for legacy systems and integration with older .NET Framework-based applications. | Preferred for cross-platform needs, high-performance applications, and modern development practices.                         |
